# simpleVslotReprap
A simple, inexpensive, rigid, and fast reprap 3d printer based on v-slot rails

This project was created as my own personal experiment to make a fast high quality printer with no exceptions on quality.   I wanted to acknowledge parts that could be easily obtained from commonly discarded items to cut down on spending.

The current BOM with most information is here.  I'll try to migrate some of that to github soon.
